# CSE-426: Machine Learning

This repository holds all of the relevant material for the class CSE-426 from Lehigh University, taught by Prof. Sihong Xie in the Fall semester of 2020.

The material included here consist of all homework assignments that were assigned (complete with questions and answers by me) and lecture notes (written and provided by Prof. Xie).

Since all of the work that I did in this class (i.e., the theory-oriented homework assignments) have been graded and reviewed as 100% correct, this repo will serve, in some ways, as a thorough solution manuel to the class.

The main purpose of this repo is to have a dedicated place for all of the material of one of the best classes that I have taken.
